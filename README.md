### Ahoy there!

## A little about me:

- I am still very new to the world of development, but it has been an ongoing interest of mine for quite some time now.

- At the time of writing, I am an undergraduate business student at CSU Sacramento. My concentration is in information systems, so I have been receiving some exposure to a variety of development methodologies and technologies through school. My graduation term will be Fall 2024. Fun fact: out of all the classes I've taken at CSUS thus far, my favorite was the Intro to Python course; I completeed the class with a final score of roughly 107%. 

- I currently do not work. My primary objective for the next few months is to continue focusing on school while also pursuing various other areas of interest outside of school. I plan to begin working again over summer, and I hope to find a career level job in some area of business that will also allow me to flex some of my tech related skills. Another fun fact about me: my first, and longest held job was at a custom guitar shop. I set up, repaired, customized, modified, and even built guitars on a daily basis. Of course, what made this job perfect for me was that, at the time, I had a deep passion for music and playing guitar; I also loved to tinker with and customize/modify things.

## Moving forward

- Since Python is the only programming language I know right now, I will mainly be trying to find projects that involve Python. I would also like to learn about more advanced concepts and features within the language. In addition to furthering my knowledge with Python, I want to familiarize myself with some of the popular tools and services that developers use like GitHub. I intend on using whatever online resources I have available to me to learn everything I can about whtatever topic grabs my interest.
